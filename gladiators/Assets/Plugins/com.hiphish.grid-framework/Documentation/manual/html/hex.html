<div class="textblock"><p ><a class="anchor" id="md_manual_hex"></a> </p><h1>The <code><a class="el" href="class_grid_framework_1_1_grids_1_1_hex_grid.html" title="A grid consisting of flat hexagonal grids stacked on top of each other.">GridFramework.Grids.HexGrid</a></code> class</h1>
<p >Hex grids resemble honeycomb patterns, they are composed of regular hexagons arranged in such a way that each hex shares an edge with another hex. The distance between two neighbouring hexes is always the same, unlike rectangular grids where two rectangles can be diagonal to each other.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="hex-inspector.png.txt" alt=""/>
</div>
<p >The size of a hex is determined by the grid’s circumscribed <code>Radius</code>: the distance between the centre of a hex and one of its vertices. A honeycomb pattern is two-dimensional, that's why hex grids are instances of <code>LayeredGrid</code>. These honeycomb patterns are then stacked on top each other, the distance between two of them being defined by the <code>Depth</code> of the grid, to form a 3D grid.</p>
<p ><img src="hex-geometry.png.txt" alt="" class="inline"/></p>
<p >The angle between two vertices is always 2/3π or 60°. The distance between opposite vertices is twice the radius. The distance between adjacent hexes is the same as the distance between adjacent edges, <code>sqrt(3)*radius</code>.</p>
<p >Hexagons can have one of two <code>Orientation</code> types: <code>Pointed</code> and <code>Flat</code>. In Grid Framework we store the orientation of the <code>Sides</code>.</p>
<h1>Coordinate systems of hexagonal grids</h1>
<p >There are five coordinate systems supported: up- and downwards herringbone, up- and downwards rhombic, and cubic. All of them work with both pointed and flat <code>Sides</code>.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="hex_grids.png.txt" alt=""/>
</div>
<p >It is easier to work with faces in hex grids rather than vertices, therefore the axes of all the coordinate systems pass through the centres of the hexagons.</p>
<h2><code>HerringboneUp</code> and <code>HerringboneDown</code></h2>
<p >A herringbone pattern is similar to a rectangular pattern, except that every odd column is shifted up or down by half a row's height. The vertical (Y) axes are all straight lines, but he horizontal (X) axes are zig-zagged. The central hex has the coordinates (0, 0).</p>
<p >If the grid has flat sides the rows are shifted left or right by half a column's width instead. The <code>HerringboneUp</code> coordinate system is shifted towards the right and the <code>HerringboneDown</code> coordinate system is shifted towards the left.</p>
<h2><code>RhombicUp</code> and <code>RhombicDown</code></h2>
<p >This pattern resembles a rhombus, hence the name. The vertical (Y) axis of the grid is pointing straight up, but the horizontal (X) axis is sheared up- or downwards at and angle of thirty degrees.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="hex_rhombic.png.txt" alt=""/>
</div>
<p >If the grid has flat sides the horizontal axis is unaltered and instead the vertical axis is sheared either thirty degrees to the right (<code>RhombicUp</code>) or thirty degrees to the left (<code>RhombicDown</code>).</p>
<h2><code>Cubic</code></h2>
<p >The <code>Cubic</code> coordinate system is somewhat of an oddball, but it is also the most powerful system if you are looking for an unbiased coordinate system, meaning a coordinate system that does not have a notion of a "correct" direction. Hexagonal grids are layered grids and each of the above coordinate systems is a two-domensional system (plus a third dimension for the layer), but cubic coordinates are three-dimensional and four-dimensional when adding the layer. Cubic coordinates are therefore stored in a <code>Vector4</code> type.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="hex-cubic.png.txt" alt=""/>
</div>
<p >The motivation behind this coordinate system is that we are interpreting the hex-grid as a planar slice through a set of cubes. The cubes are rotated such that one corner is facing towards the observer and the line between that corner and its opposite corner is perpendicular to the plane of sight. If the projection is orthographic the cube will appear as a regular hexagon to the observer.</p>
<p >A good example of this coordinate system is the arcade game Q*bert: the game's graphics are in 2D but the player's movement is in 3D. Every cube in the game world is effectively a hexagon on the screen. Furthermore, every time the player moves in one direction, they also have to move in another direction as well in Q*bert's world. The player can never move straight up or down, they also have to move left or right as well. This places a restriction on the coordinates of every axis.</p>
<p >There are three axes: X, Y and Z. In a pointy-sided hexagon the X-axis goes from the centre of the eastern vertex, the Y-axis from the centre to the north-western vertex and the Z-axis from the centre to the south-western vertex. This means the angle between the three axes is sixty degrees. In order to ensure that there is no ambiguity the sum of all three coordinates is always exactly zero, even between faces.</p>
<p >If the hexagon is flat-sided the X-axis goes from the centre to the south-eastern vertex, the Y-axis from the centre to the northern vertex and the Z-axis from the centre to the south-western vertex. The restriction that the sum of all three coordinates must be zero still applies.</p>
<p >The biggest advantage of the cubic coordinate system is that there is no preferred direction. If we take for example the <code>RhombicUp</code> coordinate system, moving on hex north-east changes one coordinate (by <code>(1,0)</code>), but moving south-west changes two coordinates (by <code>(-1, -1)</code>). This is because the coordinate system has an inherent bias. On the other hand, moving north-east in the <code>Cubic</code> coordinate system changes two coordinates (by <code>(1, 0, -1)</code>) and moving south-west changes two coordinates as well (by <code>(1, 0, -1)</code>). All of Grid Framework's internal computations use this coordinates system for that reason.</p>
<h1>Renderers for hexagonal grid</h1>
<p >There are four renderers for hexagonal grid: <code>Herringbone</code>, <code>Rectangle</code>, <code>Rhombus</code> and <code>Cone</code>.</p>
<h2>The <code><a class="el" href="class_grid_framework_1_1_renderers_1_1_hexagonal_1_1_herringbone.html" title="Herringbone pattern along the faces of the hexagons.">GridFramework.Renderers.Hexagonal.Herringbone</a></code> renderer</h2>
<p >Draw a herringbone pattern where the lines connect the hexagons. This renderer does not draw actual hexagons, only the lines connecting the centres. It can draw lines continuously. You can choose whether the shift is up- or downwards.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="hex_herring.png.txt" alt=""/>
</div>
<h2>The <code><a class="el" href="class_grid_framework_1_1_renderers_1_1_hexagonal_1_1_rectangle.html" title="A rectangular arrangement of hexagons with alternating columns or rows.">GridFramework.Renderers.Hexagonal.Rectangle</a></code> renderer</h2>
<p >Similar to the <code>Herringbone</code> renderer, except this one draws hexagons in a rectangular frame. It only draws discrete hexagons, not continuous lines. You can choose whether the shift is up- or downwards.</p>
<h2>The <code><a class="el" href="class_grid_framework_1_1_renderers_1_1_hexagonal_1_1_rhombus.html" title="A rhombic arrangement of hexagons with configurable direction.">GridFramework.Renderers.Hexagonal.Rhombus</a></code> renderer</h2>
<p >A finite slice of the <code>Rhombic</code> coordinate system; it only draws discrete hexagons, not continuous lines. You can choose whether the shift is up- or downwards.</p>
<h2>The <code><a class="el" href="class_grid_framework_1_1_renderers_1_1_hexagonal_1_1_cone.html" title="Hexagons wrapping around one central hexagon.">GridFramework.Renderers.Hexagonal.Cone</a></code> renderer</h2>
<p >A cone that is similar to the <code>Cylinder</code> renderer for the <code>PolarGrid</code> class. You get to choose an origin hex and then a "cone" or "fan" shape is drawn around it. In the <code>Cylinder</code> renderer a start and end angle are set, in the <code>Cone</code> renderer we use one of the six hexes around the origin instead. It is possible to close the cone to draw a "circle" (a large hexagon made of small hexagons).</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="hex_circle.png.txt" alt=""/>
</div>
<p >The renderer is called <code>Cone</code> because this shape can be used in games to represent a cone-shaped area of effect, such as the fire breath of a dragon. </p>
