<div class="textblock"><p ><a class="anchor" id="md_manual_rendering"></a> Grid Framework can draw grids in the Unity3D editor and has multiple facilities for rendering grids in the scene during runtime. We can only display a finite slice of the infinitely large grids, so we need special <em>renderer</em> components which let us select the slice and how to display it.</p>
<p >This section explains the conceptual difference between drawing and rendering, the various renderer components, the rendering system used by Grid Framework, and finally the different rendering backends built into Grid Framework. You can even use the rendering system to build your own backends and integrate with your own code.</p>
<h2>Drawing VS rendering</h2>
<p >We say that a grid is <em>drawn</em> when we use Unity3D gizmos to display the grid in the editor. Gizmos are simple and can be easily toggled like any other Unity3D gizmos. However, they cannot be displayed at runtime in the final build of the game.</p>
<p >To display a grid at runtime you have to <em>render</em> it. Rendering is more complicated because there is no one solution to use. We could render a grid using Unity3D's low-level <code>GL</code> class, we could generate a mesh and attach it to a <code>MeshRenderer</code> or we could integrate with a 3rd party plugin as an intermediate step. Because there is no one true way Grid Framework provides a primitive rendering system to build our own rendering backend on top of. You do not need to use the rendering system if you do not want to, there are three backends already included which will be adequate for most use cases.</p>
<h2>Renderer components</h2>
<p >A grid renderer (instance of <code><a class="el" href="class_grid_framework_1_1_renderers_1_1_grid_renderer.html" title="Abstract base class for all grid renderers.">GridFramework.Renderers.GridRenderer</a></code>) is a component which selects a particular slice from the grid for both drawing and rendering. Renderers require a grid component on their <code>GameObject</code>. For most grids there is only one corresponding renderer, but hexagonal grids have several renderers because there can be multiple shapes to render the grid as. Renderers are named after their shape, not the grid they belong to, such as <code><a class="el" href="class_grid_framework_1_1_renderers_1_1_rectangular_1_1_parallelepiped.html" title="Parallelepiped shape of a rect grid.">GridFramework.Renderers.Rectangular.Parallelepiped</a></code>.</p>
<p >We can attach multiple renderers to the same game object. This is useful if we have multiple slices of the same grid we wish to render. We can also define our own renderers, please refer to <a class="el" href="extending.html">Extending Grid Framework</a> for more information.</p>
<h2>The included backends</h2>
<p >A rendering backend is something that communicates with the low-level rendering system to actually put pixels on the screen. Backends are not a technical category, there is no backend class, it is simply an umbrella term I use for whatever class fulfills this particular purpose. Most of the time a backend is a component though. There are three rendering backends included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the low-level <code>GL</code> class</li>
<li>Constructing a mesh and letting Unity3D render it like any other mesh</li>
<li>Constructing a Vectrosity vector line and letting Vectrosity render it; requires a <a href="http://starscenesoftware.com/vectrosity.html">Vectrosity</a> license</li>
</ul>
<p >Each backend has its advantages and disadvantages, please consult the scripting reference for details. The <a href="https://gitlab.com/hiphish/grid-framework-vectrosity/">Vectrosity backend</a> available as a separate package for download.</p>
<h3>The <code>GL</code> backend</h3>
<p >Unity3D allows very low-level access to its rendering facilities through the <code>GL</code> class. This backend is simple and fast, it was the only backend supported in Grid Framework before version 3.0.</p>
<p >To render a grid you will need to attach an instance of <code>GridFramework.Rendering.GridCameraBackend</code> to one of your cameras in your scene. You can choose whether to render grids even if the camera is not the main camera. The backend will automatically pick up any grids in the scene, there is nothing more to do. All configuration is taken from the renderer itself, including the material; a default material (see <code>Plugins/Grid Framework/Resources/Default.shader</code>) is used if none is assigned.</p>
<p >The main disadvantage is that it will always render on top of sprites; sprites had not yet been introduced to Unity3D when Grid Framework originally launched. Its advantage is that it will pick up all options from the renderer, such as separate line colours per axis and line width.</p>
<h3>The mesh backend</h3>
<p >This backend offloads the rendering work to Unity3D by generating a mesh in the scene. There are two variants: one that renders only the grids of its game object and one that renders every grid in the scene.</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a class="el" href="class_grid_framework_1_1_rendering_1_1_local_mesh_backend.html" title="Grid rendering backend which renders one grid as a mesh with lines topology.">GridFramework.Rendering.LocalMeshBackend</a></code></li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="class_grid_framework_1_1_rendering_1_1_global_mesh_backend.html" title="Grid rendering backend which uses a mesh with line topology to render all grids in the scene.">GridFramework.Rendering.GlobalMeshBackend</a></code></li>
</ul>
<p >The former needs to be attached to the game object carrying the grid, while the latter needs to be attached to an arbitrary game object positioned at the <em>origin</em> of the scene.</p>
<p >The main advantage of this backend is that it integrates normally with Unity3D's rendering pipeline, and thus it works correctly with sprites. Any customisation is carried out by customising the mesh renderer component, such as setting the material to use.</p>
<h3>The Vectrosity backend</h3>
<p >This backend is available as a separate Git package free of charge. It works similar to the mesh backend, except that is uses Vectrosity to render lines. You will need a Vectrosity license. The author of Vectrosity, Eric5h5, is not affiliated with Grid Framework.</p>
<h2>Rendering performance</h2>
<p >Rendering, as well as drawing, is a two-step process: first we need to count the number of the two end points for each line, then compute them and then we need to actually render all those lines. Grid Framework will cache the computed points, meaning as long as you do not change your grid the points will not be re-computed again. That way we do not need to waste resources calculating the same values over and over again.</p>
<p >To improve performance you could adjust the rendering range of your renderer dynamically during gameplay to only render the area the player will be able to see. Of course frequently changing the range forces a re-computation of the points and defeats the purpose of caching. Still, the gain in performance can be worth it if you make sure to adjust the range only at certain thresholds. Keep in mind that if something is set not to render it will not just be invisible, it will not be rendered at all and prevent the loops from running. Turning off an axis or having a flat grid can make a noticeable difference (a 100 x 100 x 0 grid will perform better than a 100 x 100 x 1 grid).</p>
<p >The <em>Endless Grid</em> example shows how you can create the illusion of a huge grid without actually having to render the whole thing. We only render the part that will be visible plus some extra buffer. Only when the camera has been moved ten world units from the last fixed position we readjust the rendering range, thus forcing a re-computation of the draw points. This is a compromise between performance and flexibility, we can still display a large grid without the huge overhead of actually having a large grid.</p>
<h2>The rendering system</h2>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The following is only relevant if you want to implement your own backend.</dd></dl>
<p>The rendering system is a static class (<code><a class="el" href="class_grid_framework_1_1_rendering_1_1_system.html" title="The Grid Framework rendering system.">GridFramework.Rendering.System</a></code>) which acts as a message broker between renderers and backends. Renderers automatically <em>register</em> themselves with the system when they become active, so backends do not have to keep track of them individually. Backends can then <em>poll</em> the renderers through the system, which causes the renderers to see if they need to update the lines. If a renderer is updated it notifies the system, which can then notify the backends in turn.</p>

</div><!-- fragment --><p >This may seem convoluted, but it was necessary in order to keep performance reasonable. We only want renderers to compute and allocated lines if something has actually changed instead of on every frame. Here is a typical workflow:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>When a backend becomes active is registers itself for being notified when a grid has changed using the notification system of C#.</li>
<li>The backend polls the system for changes, for example during every call to <code>FixedUpdate</code>.</li>
<li>The system then tells all renderers to update themselves.</li>
<li>Every renderer which has changed computes its lines and reports back to the system.</li>
<li>The system sends out a notification to all its subscribers.</li>
<li>Each backend which has registered itself during the first step the executes its callback method.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Your own backend</h3>
<p >Your own backends will most likely be some variation of the above steps. Let us walk through a simplified implementation of the global mesh backend. I have omitted the actual mesh generation for the sake of brevity.</p>
